# VDIOptimizer
Optimize your VDI or SBC environment

As there are several optimizers for SBC/VDI environments (Microsoft, Citrix, VMware), I thought to combine them all in one easy to use hta file and add some more options the others are missing...

This HTA can be run manually so you get the GUI where you can select which options you want to activate or not.

Because there is a timer included, the settings will be done as recommended after 1 minute. You can uncheck the timer so you have more time to select the options you want.

You can use one of the install.bat/install.vbs/install.ps1 scripts to run the hta from the script that you like. They all do the same...

If you want to customize the options for future runs, just open the hta file with notepad or other text editor. Scroll down to the end.
There you will find every opion that is CHECKED for an enable option. Just add or remove CHECKED to enable or disable the option for future use.
